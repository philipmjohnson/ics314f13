  This assessment shows what percentage of students in this class signed up, paid for, and attended Startup Weekend.

  Discussion:

    * 50% of the students elected to do the Startup Weekend, which I view as an extremely positive outcome. Event 
      organizers said this was the most ICS students who ever participated in a Startup Weekend.
    * One team consisting primarily of students in this class won the ["Most likely to succeed" award](http://scotthonda.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/1441508_211096379061935_531186613_n-1.jpg).
