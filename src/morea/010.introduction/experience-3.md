# A03: Introduce yourself

## Task

For this assignment, join the [ICS 314 Google discussion group](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/ics314f13) and, once your request to
join has been approved, post a short introductory paragraph about yourself.
This provides info to your fellow students, and also verifies that you have
joined the discussion group and can post to it. 

Unfortunately, you cannot join
the discussion group using your hawaii.edu account. Youâ€™ll need to sign up
using a gmail account. If you need to create a gmail account specifically
for this purpose, make sure to forward all of its mail to your hawaii.edu
account so that you receive postings in a timely manner. 

It is your
responsibility to receive information about this class via the newsgroup
promptly. In general, this means you should configure the group settings to
send each message posted to the group as an email to the gmail address you
provided. Then use forwarding to get it to one (or more) email address(es)
that you read regularly. 

Assume it might take up to 12 hours for me to notice
your request to join and to approve your membership in the group, so don't
wait until the last minute to do this task.

## Submission instructions:

This assignment must be completed by the time and date indicated on the
Schedule page.
