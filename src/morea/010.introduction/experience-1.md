# A01: Get the books

## Task

Following the information in the Overview lecture, obtain access to:

  * [Thinking in Java, 4th Ed](http://mindview.net/Books/TIJ4). Download the free chapters and read them. If you already know all of the information in them, then you probably don't need to buy the book, and you can just use online sources for any Java questions you have.

  * [Elements of Java Style](http://www.amazon.com/Elements-Java-Style-Reference-Library/dp/0521777682).  This book is mandatory; you will need it for the Coding Standards module.

  * [Play for Java](http://www.manning.com/leroux/).  This book will be helpful when we start using the Play Framework.  You do not need to buy it until we reach that part of the course.

## Submission instructions

Make sure you have Elements of Java Style and Play for Java by the time those
modules start. I will not assign anything from Thinking in Java, but I will
assume you are a competent Java programmer.




An experiential learning opportunity.
