# A09: FizzBuzz in Eclipse

## Task

Implement the FizzBuzz program in Java. Time how long it took you to
implement, from the moment you opened the Eclipse editor to the moment you
verified that you obtained the output correctly. 

Recall that the FizzBuzz
program should print out all of the numbers from 1 to 100, one per line,
except that when the number is a multiple of 3, you print "Fizz", when a
multiple of 5, you print "Buzz", and when a multiple of both 3 and 5, you
print "FizzBuzz". 

As part of this program, you should implement some sort of
test of the program to ensure that it works correctly. If you know JUnit, you
can use that. Otherwise you can just write another class called something like
TestFizzBuzz that ensures correct behavior under a reasonably chosen set of
conditions. 

Enable the Checkstyle plugin for this Eclipse project, and remove
any errors that Checkstyle identifies in your code. 

When you have finished,
write a blog posting that discusses your experiences. Include a copy of your
completed FizzBuzz program, indicate the time it took you to implement it.
Make sure that the program text is not cut off and that indentation appears
correctly. Use the 
[code](http://en.support.wordpress.com/code/posting-source-code/) or 
[gist](http://en.support.wordpress.com/gist/) shortcodes to embed
your program text. 

Discuss what problems you ran into (either with Java,
Checkstyle, or Eclipse), and how you solved them. Finally, what has the
experience revealed to you about software engineering, and this class? 

Note: Although you are timing yourself, this is not a "race" to see who can do this
assignment the fastest. Instead, it is an opportunity for you to reflect on
what happens when you program, where you spend your time while doing it, and
what you might try to do to improve in future.
