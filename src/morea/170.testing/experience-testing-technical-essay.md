# A27: Testing

By the date and time indicated on the calendar page, you should attempt this practice WOD at least once, and write a blog entry that summarizes your experience developing it.  Do not include the source code in your blog entry. Instead, provide a brief introduction to the assignment along with a link to this page for further details, then discuss your experiences with each practice WOD.

Describe how long it took to finish for each attempt and what you learned.  For each WOD that you DNF’d, explain what happened and what you learned.  If you did a WOD multiple times, report the times of all of your attempts and what you learned by doing them more than once. Make sure your writing is “for the world”, not “for the instructor”.   You should take time to create a well-structured blog entry, as the material is getting complicated.

Send johnson@hawaii.edu an email with a link to your finished blog entry. Make sure your link starts with “http:” so that I can click on it in my mailer. Make sure that it also appears as one of your postings when someone clicks on the “Postings” link of your professional portfolio.  Note: the subject line must be [ICS 314: A27].  If the subject line is different, then I might not see the email and you might not get credit for this assignment.
