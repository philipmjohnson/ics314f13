# Surferpedia Testing

For this assignment, you will create a set of tests for your surferpedia (final exam) project.  This involves:

  1. Designing the test as a use case.  This means specifying the “end-to-end” interaction with the system.  For example: (a) Retrieve the home page; (b) search for the Surfer Eddie Aikau; (c) Verify that the search results page contains Eddie Aikua; (d) Retrieve the Eddie Aikau home page; (e) Verify that the Eddie Aikau home page has been retrieved.
  2. Creating an issue corresponding to the test.   The issue can be closed once the test is implemented and passes for the first time.

Your test cases should strive to be “comprehensive”.  Since that can be interpreted in a wide variety of ways, for the purposes of this assignment “comprehensive” means that:

  * All page templates in your application have been retrieved at some point in your tests.
  * All form elements have been manipulated at some point in your tests.
  * All links and buttons have been clicked at some point in your tests.

You should design at least 12 tests, and the responsibility for their implementation should be divided up evenly between team members.

This is due as part of the Final Exam assignment.  You can decide which of your tests are part of which milestone.
