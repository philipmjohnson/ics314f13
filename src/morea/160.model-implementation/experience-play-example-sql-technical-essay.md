# A25: play-example-mysql Technical Essay

By the date and time indicated on the calendar page, write a blog entry that summarizes your experiences getting the play-example-mysql system to run both locally and in the cloud.  Provide a brief introduction to the assignment along with a link to this page for further details, then discuss your experiences. What was easy? What was difficult?

Send johnson@hawaii.edu an email with a link to your finished blog entry. Make sure your link starts with “http:” so that I can click on it in my mailer. Make sure that it also appears as one of your postings when someone clicks on the “Postings” link of your professional portfolio.  Note: the subject line must be [ICS 314: A25].  If the subject line is different, then I might not see the email and you might not get credit for this assignment.
