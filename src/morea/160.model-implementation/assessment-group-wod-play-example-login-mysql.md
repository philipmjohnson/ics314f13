  Students worked in groups in-class to add a MySQL backend to the play-example-login system 
  and deploy it to the cloud.

  Discussion:

     * This WOD requires about an hour to implement for Rx time; thus the groups either finished or DNF'd
       with Rx time because classtime ran out after an hour. Ideally, groups would have had up to 90 minutes
       to complete this WOD.
