# A06: Join TechHui

## Task

This assignment helps you develop your networking skills and professional
relationships. With the advent of social network technologies, it is easier
than ever to create (or destroy) an online reputation. For this assignment,
you will practice your "professional" social networking skills in the context
of the TechHui social network. 

First, joinÂ [TechHui](http://www.techhui.com/),
and include a "professionally appropriate" photograph of yourself. 

Second, join
the [uh-ics-students](http://www.techhui.com/group/uhicsstudents) group.

Third, post a comment to both the "Three bad things about being an ICS
student" and "Three good things about being an ICS student". Remember that
every post you make to TechHui becomes part of your "permanent record". The
goal of this exercise is to help you think about how to provide both positive
and negative feedback in a way that you won't regret later. 

Note: it might be
tempting to simply read previous entries and post a "me too" response. You
will regret that later: it gives the impression that you are not capable of
independent thought. Take the time to respond in a thoughtful, creative, and
insightful manner.

## Submission instructions

By the date and time specified on the Schedule page, send johnson@hawaii.edu
an email with a link to your home page on TechHui. Make sure your links begin
with http: so they are clickable in my mailer. I will then check the uh-ics-students group for your comments.

Note: the subject line must be **[ICS 314: A06]**. If the subject line is different, then I might not see the email and
you might not get credit for this assignment.
