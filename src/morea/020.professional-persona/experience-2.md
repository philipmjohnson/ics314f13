# A02: Environment configuration

For this assignment, you will begin the process of creating a high quality
software engineering environment on your computer.

## Task 1: Have appropriate hardware

Preferred hardware is a laptop with >= 2 Ghz processor, >= 2 GB RAM, >= 20 GB
free disk space, and wireless access. As noted in the lecture, a Dell Laptop
satisfies these requirements for $500-$1000. Note that “netbooks” are not
suited for professional software development: while more portable, their
screens are too small and they generally have less RAM and slower CPUs.

## Task 2: Install an appropriate operating system

An up to date release of Mac OS/X or a Linux-based OS are the preferred
operating systems for this class. If you must use Windows, you should use
the latest release.

If needed, I can sign you up for MSDNAA, which will provide you with a free copy
of the latest Windows OS.

## Task 3: Install Java 7

### Windows/Linux

Download and install the Java 7 JDK and JavaDoc documentation
from [here](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html).
Be sure to download and install the "JDK" package, which includes both the JRE and additional tools such as ‘jar’ , ‘javadoc’, and ‘javac’. Don’t download the “JRE” package.

On Windows, you must change the default installation directory to a file path that does not contain spaces. The default on Windows is c:\Program Files\Java, which is bogus. Change it to something like c:\Java. You will run into problems if you install the JDK inside c:\Program Files\.

Add <java>/bin to your PATH variable, where <java> is replaced by the location where you installed it.

Also download the Java SE 7 Documentation. Unzip the documentation package into <java>.
If you have installed Java correctly, then you should be able to type “java
-version” and “jar -help” at the command line and get reasonable responses. If
you have installed the documentation correctly, then you should be able to
retrieve it in a browser using a local URL such as:
`file:///C:/Java/jdk1.7.0_02/docs/index.html`. 

The most useful link is to the
JavaDocs, at an URL like: `file:///C:/Java/jdk1.7.0_02/docs/api/index.html`.

### Macintosh

You must be running Snow Leopard (10.6) or later. To ensure you
are running Java 7 by default, see the [JDK 7 Mac Install Page](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/webnotes/install/mac/mac-jdk.html).

## Task 4: Spell Philip correctly

For the past few semesters, a gentleman with the email address
‘phillipmjohnson@gmail.com’ has been receiving emails from ICS software
engineering students intended for me. He is quite frustrated and wants this to
stop. I apologized, told him that I would make a point of informing the class
of the correct spelling (philipmjohnson@gmail.com), and that he should simply
delete any future emails without replying. So, be very careful to spell my
name correctly. If you misspell it on an assignment submission, you might not
get credit!

## Submission instructions

You are expected to bring your laptop to class every day. During a class
period on or after the date associated with this assignment on the Calendar
page, I will review your environment in class.
