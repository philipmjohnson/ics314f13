# A07: Join LinkedIn

## Task

LinkedIn is the most important global professional networking site. Many ICS
students have obtained jobs just by having an appropriate listing in LinkedIn.

For this assignment, you will continue to develop your professional persona by
creating a profile on LinkedIn. Go toÂ [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/) and
create a profile, if you do not have one already. 

You should strive to
achieve a 100% filled out profile, as illustrated below:

Be
sure to provide a link to your professional portfolio as your "Personal
Website". Note that although your LinkIn profile will overlap somewhat with
your Professional Portfolio site, you can go into much greater depth on your
projects and accomplishments in your portfolio than you can in LinkedIn.

## Submission instructions

By the date and time specified on the Schedule page, please send
johnson@hawaii.edu a link to your LinkedIn profile. Note: the subject line
must be **[ICS 314: A07]**. If the subject line is different, then I might
not see the email and you might not get credit for this assignment.
