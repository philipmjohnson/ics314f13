# Create a professional portfolio

Your "professional persona" is your online presence that is visible to
potential colleagues and employers. A key component of your professional
persona is your professional portfolio site, where you can present your skills
and accomplishments in a useful and engaging manner. By having all members of
the class create professional portfolios using the same technology
(WordPress), each member can learn from others and thus raise the quality of
everyone's portfolio. Prior to beginning this assignment you should have
watched both screencasts in the Resources section of this module, and reviewed
the [Professional Portfolio Style Guide](reading-4.html).

## Task: Design and implement your professional portfolio.

First, create a free account at wordpress.com. Choose a username at WordPress
that will be suitable for your professional portfolio. For example, my
username is "philipmjohnson". 

Second, following the procedures outlined in the
screencast, create a site to serve as your professional portfolio that
satisfies the requirements in the Professional Portfolio Style
Guide. 

Third, create a single posting
(approximately 3-4 paragraphs) that discusses your interests in software
engineering and what kinds of skills and experiences you hope to have in the
next four months. 

## Submission instructions

By the date and time indicated
on the Schedule page, send johnson@hawaii.edu an email with a link to your
professional portfolio. Your URL should start with "http:" so that my mailer
will recognize it as an URL and make it clickable. 

Note: the subject line
must be **[ICS 314: A04]**. If the subject line is different, then I might
not see the email and you might not get credit for this assignment.
