  This assessment verified that students implemented a professional portfolio 
  that satisfied the guidelines in the [Professional Portfolio Style Guide](/morea/020.professional-persona/reading-4.html).

  Discussion:

    * Some portfolios failed checklist items (remove commenting mechanism, poor home page picture, navbar does not link directly to PDF resume, home page not informative)
    * Some resumes were poor quality (comic sans font)
