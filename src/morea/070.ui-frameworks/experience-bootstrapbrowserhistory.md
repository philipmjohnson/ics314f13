# Practice WOD: BootstrapBrowserHistory

Prior to doing this WOD, you should have: (a) completed the Bootstrap Bookmarks assignment; (b) watched all the bootstrap-example-intro screencasts; and (c) practiced downloading the bootstrap-example-intro code for use as templates (as shown in the screencasts), and (d) completed the BrowserHistory3 WOD from the UIBasics module, and have that project available to you within Eclipse.

## Instructions

  1. Start your timer.
  2. Create an Eclipse project called BootstrapBrowserHistory and use it to implement a Bootstrap version of BrowserHistory3. 
  3. Use the default bootstrap theme, change the title and navbar logo to “A history of browsers”,  create a three column responsive layout, and use the “well” class to provide some visual interest. 

The following image shows what it should look like (click to see full size):

When finished, stop your timer, and record how many minutes it took you to complete the WOD.
