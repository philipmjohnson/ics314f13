# Practice WOD: Web IO CountWords

Prior to starting this WOD, you might want to learn about the [Apache HTTPComponents library](http://hc.apache.org/index.html). It provides useful classes to simplify Web-based interactions, as shown in the example on [this page](http://hc.apache.org/httpcomponents-client-ga/tutorial/html/fundamentals.html).


## Instructions

  1. Start your timer.
  2. Create an Eclipse project called WebIO-CountWords.  
  3. Enable Checkstyle for this project. 
  4. Write a program that reads in the contents of the web page [http://www.cnn.com](), determines how many whitespace-delimited tokens (i.e. “words”) are in the file, and writes that integer to System.out.

When finished, stop your timer, and record how many minutes it took you to complete the WOD. Your program must satisfy our coding standards. You can copy/paste code from the prior program. 

{% include wod-times.html Rx="<15 min" Av="15-20 min" Sd="20-30 min" DNF="30+ min" %}

## Demonstration

Once you've finished doing the WOD a single time, watch me do it:
