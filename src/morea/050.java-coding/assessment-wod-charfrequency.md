  CharFrequency is the first “real” WOD of the semester. Students were asked to implement a Java program which differs only slightly from the last Java Practice WOD.

  Discussion:

    * Half the class completed the WOD successfully, which is a reasonable starting point.  My hope is that the percentage of DNFs will decrease as the semester continues and everyone gets more experienced.
