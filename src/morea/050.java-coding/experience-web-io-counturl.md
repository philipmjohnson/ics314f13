# Practice WOD: Web IO CountURL

Prior to starting this WOD, you might want to review [how to create launch configurations in Eclipse](http://help.eclipse.org/kepler/index.jsp?topic=%2Forg.eclipse.jdt.doc.user%2Ftasks%2Ftasks-java-local-configuration.htm&cp=1_3_6_3) and [how to create JAR files in Eclipse](http://help.eclipse.org/kepler/index.jsp?topic=%2Forg.eclipse.jdt.doc.user%2Ftasks%2Ftasks-33.htm).


## Instructions

  1. Start your timer.
  2. Create an Eclipse project called WebIO-CountURL.  
  3. Enable Checkstyle for this project. 
  4. Write a program that reads in a URL from the command line,  determines how many whitespace-delimited tokens (i.e. “words”) are in the page corresponding to that URL, and writes that integer to System.out. If the page cannot be retrieved (i.e. the URL is malformed), then the program should signal an error.

When finished, stop your timer, and record how many minutes it took you to complete the WOD. Your program must satisfy our coding standards. You can copy/paste code from the prior program.
