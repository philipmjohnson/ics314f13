# An athletic approach to software engineering

[CrossFit](http://www.crossfit.com/) has the concept of a "Workout of the Day"
([WOD](http://www.crossfit.com/cf-info/faq.html#General0)), which is a short
duration, high intensity set of exercises.  In this class, I adapt this
concept to software engineering education.  My hope is that by focusing on
the speed with which you implement high quality solutions to short development
problems, you will:

  1. Gain fluency with your tools and technologies.
  2. Gain the ability to focus and enter the "flow state" during software development.
  3. Become more productive and useful in "bursty" development environments like [startup weekends](http://startupweekend.org/).

For more background on my approach to "athletic software engineering", you can read
this [essay](http://philipmjohnson.org/2013/07/12/athletic-software-engineering-education/).

## Rx, Av, Sd, DNF

For each WOD, I provide the following timing information:

  * Rx (As prescribed): Finishing the WOD in Rx time indicates mastery of the material tested by the WOD.
  * Av (Advanced): Finishing the WOD in Av time indicates superior performance.
  * Sd (Standard): Finishing the WOD in Sd time indicates acceptable performance.
  * DNF (Did not finish): If you take longer than Sd time, then you have taken an unacceptably long amount of time.

Here is an example:

{% include wod-times.html Rx="<8 min" Av="8-13 min" Sd="13-18 min" DNF="18+ min" %}

So, in this example, completing the
WOD in 8 minutes or less is "as prescribed", 8 to 13 minutes is
"Advanced", 13 to 18 minutes is "standard", and taking longer than 18 minutes is
unacceptably slow. 

Note that simply stopping work at a certain time does not
mean you achieved the associated standard: your solution must have acceptable quality as well.

## Practice WODS

For each module, I provide practice WODs as homework assignments,
which you can time on your own. Before starting a WOD, I recommend you review
and study the associated material so that you do not spend valuable seconds
during the WOD doing "research". 

## Assessment WODS

After providing you with time to practice some WODs, I will hold an assessment
WOD, during which I will time your performance and your solution will be submitted
for grading. For grading purposes, the criteria is that you solve the problem
with acceptable quality under the DNF cut-off time. 

**Your grade does not depend upon whether you performed at Rx, Av, or Sd levels, only that you complete the WOD correctly before the DNF cutoff time.**

The general procedure for an assessment WOD is as follows:

  * You have your own "WOD-velope", which is an envelope containing an index card where we will keep track of your WOD scores.
  * On the day of a WOD, you pick up your WOD-velope from me and fill out the date, the name of the WOD, and your [HEBS (homework, exercise, breakfast, sleep) score](reading-hebs.html).
  * Once everyone is ready, I start a timer and give out the WOD assignment.
  * When you finish the WOD, raise your hand. I will come and tell you your elapsed time. You record that on the index card and I collect your WOD-velope.
  * When the WOD is finished (i.e. at the DNF cut-off time), everyone stops work and sends me their program data.
  * After class, I check each WOD assignment and give a grade. I also write down Rx, Av, Sd, or DNF on the index card. You can only receive Rx, Av, or Sd if you complete the WOD correctly and within the time frame for that performance level.
