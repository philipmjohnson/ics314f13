# Practice WOD: Web IO FrequencyURL

Prior to starting this WOD, you may want to review the [TreeMap class](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/TreeMap.html).

## Instructions

  1. Start your timer.
  2. Create an Eclipse project called WebIO-FrequencyURL.
  3. Enable Checkstyle for this project. 
  4. Write a program that reads in a URL from the command line,  and prints out a list of the whitespace-delimited tokens found in that URL and their frequency. The list should be sorted in alphabetical order.  

For example, if the URL retrieves a page containing the text “twinkle twinkle little star”, the output might look like:

    little 1
    star 1
    twinkle 2

If the page cannot be retrieved (i.e. the URL is malformed), then the program should signal an error.

When finished, stop your timer, and record how many minutes it took you to complete the WOD. Your program must satisfy our coding standards. You can copy/paste code from the prior program. 

{% include wod-times.html Rx="<12 min" Av="12-16 min" Sd="16-25 min" DNF="25+ min" %}

## Demonstration

Once you've finished doing the WOD a single time, watch me do it:
