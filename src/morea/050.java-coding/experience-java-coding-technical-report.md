# A10: Java Coding Technical Report

By the date and time indicated on the Schedule page, you should attempt all of these practice WODs at least once, and write a technical report (blog entry) that summarizes your experiences developing them.  

Do not include the source code in your technical report. Instead, provide a brief introduction to the assignment along with a link to this page for further details, then discuss your experiences with each practice WOD.  

For each practice WOD that you finished, describe how long it took to finish and what you learned (about Java, Eclipse, and/or coding standards). For each practice WOD that you DNF’d, explain why that happened and what you learned.  If you did a WOD multiple times, report the times of all of your attempts and what you learned by doing them more than once. Make sure your writing is “for the world”, not “for the instructor”.

Send johnson@hawaii.edu an email with a link to your finished blog entry. Make sure your link starts with “http:” so that I can click on it in my mailer. Make sure that it also appears as one of your postings when someone clicks on the “Postings” link of your professional portfolio.  Note: the subject line must be [ICS 314: A10].  If the subject line is different, then I might not see the email and you might not get credit for this assignment.
