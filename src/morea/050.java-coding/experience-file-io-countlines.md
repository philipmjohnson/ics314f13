# Practice WOD: File IO CountLines

Prior to starting this WOD, you might want to familiarize yourself with [File IO in Java 7](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/io/fileio.html). 

## Instructions

  1. Start your timer.
  2. Download [this page](experience-file-io-countlines.html) onto your local computer, and name it webpage.html. 
  3. In Eclipse, create a project called FileIO-CountLines.  
  4. Enable Checkstyle for this project. 
  5. Write a program that reads in webpage.html, determines how many lines are in that file, and writes that integer to System.out.

When finished, stop your timer, and record how many minutes it took you to complete the WOD. Your program must satisfy our coding standards.  

{% include wod-times.html Rx="<10 min" Av="10-15 min" Sd="15-20 min" DNF="20+ min" %}

## Demonstration

Once you've finished doing the WOD a single time, watch me do it:
