  This was a "take-home" WOD in which students were on the honor system to do the WOD at home and report their results via email.  The task was
  to create an ER diagram for the play-example-form application and upload it to a GitHub repo for display in the README page. 

  Discussion:

     * While times were not instructor-verified, I feel confident they are accurate.
