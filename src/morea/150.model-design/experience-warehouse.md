# Practice WOD: Warehouse

The goal of this WOD is to get comfortable diagraming using Lucid Charts. Read Chapter 7, Section 1 on the Warehouse model. Also review the Model Design Guidelines.

## Instructions

Please construct an ER diagram using Lucid Charts of the Warehouse application described in Chapter 7.

  1. Start your timer.
  2. Call your chart ERD-Warehouse.
  3. Use Lucid Charts and the appropriate crows foot notations. 
  4. Specify the entity fields in your entity descriptions. Be careful to exclude Java fields that implement relationships.
  5. Make sure to follow the model design guidelines. 
  6. When finished, download a PNG file containing your description. 

When finished, stop your timer, and record how many minutes it took you to complete the WOD.
