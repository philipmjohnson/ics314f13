  This assessment evaluated the ability of students to write a high quality technical essay summarizing their experiences doing the UI Basics practice WODs.

  Discussion:

    * It appears that if you don't repeat WODs until you get AV, you run a high risk of DNF'ing on the in-class WOD.

    * Some of you are publishing rather sloppy, meandering descriptions of your experience.  Starting next week, I will deduct points for a posting that does not have minimally acceptable structure and content, including:
      * You describe each practice WOD in its own section.
      * You summarize the goal of each practice WOD.
      * You clearly specify the number of attempts (and the Rx/Av/Sd/DNF value) for each practice WOD.
      * You articulate interesting insight into the experience and insights you gained from the practice WODs.
