# Practice WOD: BrowserHistory1

Prior to starting this WOD, you should have: (a) installed the WebTools and Word Wrap plugins into Eclipse, (b) installed LiveReload for automatic browser refresh (or decided to do it manually), and (c) studied the HTML tutorial in the Resources section.

## Instructions

  1. Start your timer.
  2. Create an Eclipse project called BrowserHistory1, and a file within it called index.html. 
  3. If you’re using LiveReload, enable it for this folder.  
  4. Make the index.html file contain an HTML document whose title and top-level section is named “A history of browsers”.
  5. Structure the document into four subsections: ["Introduction“](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14qTjKdnAviPcuFimbtG37Fm42NmgrkSpW9dHoV5VK1o/edit?usp=sharing), [“A brief history of IE“](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vRdcV1x-PemcMv3XRickuyeuRjXHkMxgRBBYqYBNcdA/edit?usp=sharing), [“A brief history of Firefox“](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1K3j5HwVhhDmmz63QxDxUNsf3ZjM7eEPuOS-Fj2InnTA/edit?usp=sharing), and [“A brief history of Chrome“](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JFEs2_Wd8F2TsbBfhhzPALWIRTACoeOzCRtBIpRgbbs/edit?usp=sharing).  The links take you to text you can use for each of these sections. Be sure to preserve the paragraphs.
  6. Create one link within each section to an external web page.  Choose what to link yourself. For example, if the text mentions “Google”, you can make that text link to “http://www.google.com“.  Since there are four sections, there should be four links total.  Choose a different link for each section.
  7. Create an initial section called “Table of Contents”, and create an itemized list within it with links to each of the four internal sections (Introduction, Internet Explorer, Firefox, Chrome) in this document.
  8. Finally, the three sections describing the browsers should start with their logos. Here are links to the logos: [IE](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/10/Internet_Explorer_7_Logo.png), [Firefox](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/ff/Mozilla_Firefox_logo_2013.png), [Chrome](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e2/Google_Chrome_icon_%282011%29.svg).  The logos should be displayed in the page with a width of 100 pixels.

When finished, stop your timer, and record how many minutes it took you to complete the WOD.
