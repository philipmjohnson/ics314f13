# WOD: Browser History 4

For this WOD, you will split the one page, three column "History of Browsers" web page into four separate web pages: a front page with three browser icons which link to three other pages containing the history of those three browsers.

So, the index.html page will look like this:

{% include small-img.html url="http://ics314f13.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/browserhistory4-index.png" %}

And one of the interior pages (firefox.html) will look like this:

{% include small-img.html url="http://ics314f13.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/browserhistory4-firefox.png" %}

Here are the specifications:

  * Create an Eclipse project called "BrowserHistory4"
  * Copy index.html and style.css from BrowserHistory3 into this project.
  * Change index.html so that it contains only three icons, each 300 px wide. Float them, don't create a list.
  * Each icon links to a separate page with the history of that browser.  These pages are named firefox.html, ie.html, and chrome.html
  * Each history page is titled "A history of <X>", where X is that browser, and has a top-level section with the same name as the title.
  * Each history page has its corresponding icon inset into the text similarly to BrowserHistory3.
  * All history text is copied from BrowserHistory3.
  * All pages have a black background and white text and the same Google fonts as in BrowserHistory3.
