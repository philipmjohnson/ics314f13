# ICS 314: Software Engineering I

## Goals

The primary goal of ICS 314: Software Engineering is to advance your ability to design
and implement high quality software systems using open source software
development principles. 

We accomplish this by taking a technological approach
to the presentation of traditional software engineering concepts like
specification, modeling, analysis, and design. By the end of the semester, you
will acquire significant new skills with useful tools including: the
[Java](http://java.sun.com/j2se/) and [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/)
programming languages, the [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/) integrated
development environment, the [JUnit](http://www.junit.org/) testing framework,
the [git](http://git-scm.com/) configuration management system and
[GitHub](https://github.com/) cloud-based project hosting, the
[Play](http://www.playframework.org/) web application framework, and the
[Checkstyle](http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/),
[PMD](http://pmd.sourceforge.net/), and
[FindBugs](http://findbugs.sourceforge.net/) automated quality assurance
tools.

A second goal is to help you establish a "professional online
persona". This includes: (a) a professional portfolio web site; (b) a
set of publicly available software projects in which you have
participated; (c) a technical blog written by you with well-written
articles; and (d) participation in professional networking sites such
as LinkedIn and TechHui.


A third goal is for you to develop effective strategies for writing, to use
and value writing as a tools for learning, and to learn to write in an
appropriate manner for software engineering. You will do a substantial amount
of writing for this course, well over 16 pages or 4,000 words, and you must
adequately complete all writing assignments in order to pass the course with a
grade of D or better. For these reasons, ICS 314 is designated as a [writing
intensive](https://www.hawaii.edu/gened/focus/w.htm) course.

## Pedagogy

ICS 314 is structured as a sequential series of [modules](menu-modules.html),
each taking approximately a week to complete. Each module has the following
structure:

  * One or more [learning outcomes](menu-outcomes.html), describing the major goals for the module.
  * One or more [readings and other online resources](menu-readings.html), providing background material.
  * One or more [experiential learning activities](menu-experiences.html), providing a structured set of challenges enabling you to acquire mastery of material.
  * One or more [assessments](menu-assessments.html), measuring your success in achieving the learning outcomes.

ICS 314 also implements an educational technique called [athletic software
engineering](http://philipmjohnson.org/2013/07/12/athletic-software-engineering-education/),
which relies heavily on [WODs (Workouts of the Day)](readings-wods.html) 
to help you acquire mastery of the concepts in this
course.

## Prior results

While ICS software engineering requires discipline and effort, the results
appear to be worth the investment. Here are some recent course evaluation
comments:

>This class, more than any other ICS class I've taken, teaches you about the
"real world" skills that aren't taught in other courses - most of which have
to do with learning how to collaborate with a team of programmers. The class
has a pretty heavy load, but it's worth it. Everything you do in class is
meant to benefit you directly. (Fall, 2013)


>It was fun learning all of these software engineering methods, concept,
tools, ideas, etc. I was a software engineer in a tech company, and we did use
many similar tools that Dr. Johnson went over. For example, I used Ant,
Eclipse, JUnit, etc. I definitely feel that I gained very applicable knowledge
and skills after completing this class. It's a definite must for prospective
software engineers. (Fall, 2011)

> This course teaches you about teamwork, automatic build systems, maintaining
impeccable code, and project management, which are all important in the
industry. There are no other classes in the ICS department that offers such
hands-on and novel assignments. In fact, there are no other classes like ICS
413 and professors like Johnson anywhere in Hawaii. (Fall, 2010)

On the other hand, some students find the workload to be stressful, as shown
by this comment:

> A very spirited instructor, sometimes too spirited. The constant
requirements for the class both with studying materials and programming can be
overwhelming to a student of typical course & out of school load (other
classes and work/family obligations). (Fall, 2009)

For additional student perspectives on my teaching, please see my [unedited
course evaluations since 2007](http://www.hawaii.edu/ecafe/published-results.html?id=1912), with hundreds of comments (both positive and negative).

## Future benefits

The skills you acquire in ICS 314 provide professional advantages:

   <blockquote>
    It has been my experience that learning technologies like Ant, JUnit,
    Eclipse, and Subversion and practices like Code Reviews, Extreme Programming, and User Testing will separate you
    from the rest of crowd when applying for entry level Software Engineering positions. While recruiting and evaluating
    University of Hawaii ICS students one of the first questions I ask is "Did you take Software Engineering?" Followed
    by, "Do you know what JUnit is?"
