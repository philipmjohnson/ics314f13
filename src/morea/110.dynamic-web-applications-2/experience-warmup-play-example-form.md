# Pre-WOD warmup: play-example-form

Prior to starting the WODs, please study the [play-example-form](http://ics-software-engineering.github.io/play-example-form/) system. Be sure to watch my screencast in the readings. 

Then, do the following to familiarize yourself with the code:

  1. Download the system, run it, and play with the form in your browser, submitting both correct and incorrect input values.
  2. Trace through the code that is executed when a form is submitted, starting with the routes file, then to the Application controller method, then to the various classes and methods used to process the form.
  3. Display an empty form in the browser, then use Chrome Developer Tools to inspect the source.   Be sure you understand how this HTML source was generated from the various view templates.
  4. Trace the code that is executed when retrieving a pre-existing student using http://localhost:9000/?id=1, starting with the routes file, then to the Application controller method, then to the various classes and methods used to process the request.
  5. Once a pre-existing student is displayed, use Chrome Developer Tools to inspect the source. Be sure you understand how this HTML source was generated from the various view templates.
