# A20: Dynamic Surferpedia Technical Essay

By the time and date indicated on the Calendar page, please:

  * Implement the dynamic Surferpedia system. Test the system to ensure that you have implemented the CRUD operations successfully. Make sure that you cannot create a new surfer with a previously existing slug.
  * Update the README.md file with screenshots and usage instructions. Note that you finally have an application that benefits from user-level documentation!
  * Push all your changes to GitHub, and create a release called “Dynamic Surferpedia” with tag “dynamic-surferpedia”.
  * Create a blog entry discussing your experiences implementing this system.  What did you find easy?  What did you find difficult?
  * If you completed all the functional requirements for the system, indicate that in your blog entry. If you did not complete all of the functional requirements, indicate the ones that you missed.
  * Indicate in your blog entry how you collaborated with your partner. How many times did you get together? Did you get together face-to-face or via Google Hangouts? Was the collaboration effective or not?

Email to johnson@hawaii.edu a link to your blog entry and a link to your release. Make sure your link starts with “http:” so that I can click on it in my mailer. Make sure that it also appears as one of your postings when someone clicks on the “Postings” link of your professional portfolio.  Note: the subject line must be [ICS 314: A20].  If the subject line is different, then I might not see the email and you might not get credit for this assignment.
