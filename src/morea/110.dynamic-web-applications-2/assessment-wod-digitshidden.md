  This was a solo WOD in which the students had to design a scala template to abstract away some raw html code in their view.  The WOD required them to touch just two files in their Digits application.

  Discussion:

     * This WOD showed more variability than I expected; I had assumed this would be very easy for the class.  The finish time went from 5 minutes for the best finisher to a DNF at 21 minutes.  The percentage DNF continues to fall, although five students have now dropped the class, which may account for the low percentage of DNF.
