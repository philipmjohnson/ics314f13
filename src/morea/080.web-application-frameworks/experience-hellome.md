# Practice WOD: HelloMe

Prior to starting this WOD, you should have studied the Play tutorial and read the first three chapters of the Play for Java book as noted in the Resources section of this module.

## Instructions

  1. Start your timer.
  2. Create a default Play application called HelloMe.
  3. Generate the Eclipse project files using the Play console.  
  4. Open this project in Eclipse, and edit the source code so that the resulting web application generates a page containing only the words “Hello, Me!”. The title of the page should also be “Hello, Me!”

Your application should present the following page:

{% include small-img.html url="http://ics314f13.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/hello-me.png" %}

When finished, stop your timer, and record how many minutes it took you to complete the WOD. 

{% include wod-times.html Rx="<3 min" Av="3-5 min" Sd="5-7 min" DNF="7+ min" %}

## Demonstration

Once you've finished doing the WOD a single time, watch me do it:
