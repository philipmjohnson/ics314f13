  MultiPageKamanu is a variant of the PlayResponsiveKamanu practice WOD.

  Discussion:

     * For the first time in an individual WOD, the number of DNFs fell substantially below 50%.  In addition, more students obtained Rx time on this WOD than ever before.  These appear to be encouraging trends.
