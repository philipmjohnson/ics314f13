# Practice WOD: PlayBootstrapBrowserHistory

Before starting this WOD, make sure that you have successfully completed the BootstrapBrowserHistory WOD, and that the BootstrapBrowserHistory Eclipse project is open in your Eclipse.

Also, review this screencast documenting the play-bootstrap-template project:

{% include youtube.html id="HfRIndfHUBs" %}

## Instructions

  1. Start your timer.
  2. Create a Play application called PlayBootstrapBrowserHistory by downloading the [play-bootstrap-template](https://github.com/ics-software-engineering/play-bootstrap-template) repository, then renaming the directory, the Eclipse project, and the Play project to “PlayBootstrapBrowserHistory”.  (Note that you’ll edit the build.sdt file to change the Play project name; see [this screencast](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGyhtOOsSrc) for details.)  
  3. Now enable Checkstyle on your project.   If there are any errors or warnings, remove them.
  4. Now edit the application so that the page displayed is the same as the one you created in BootstrapBrowserHistory.
  5. Your Eclipse project should contain no errors or warnings. 

Your application should present the following page:

{% include small-img.html url="http://ics314f13.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/playbootstrapbrowserhistory2.png" %}

When finished, stop your timer, and record how many minutes it took you to complete the WOD. 

{% include wod-times.html Rx="<7 min" Av="7-11 min" Sd="11-18 min" DNF="18+ min" %}

## Demonstration

Once you've finished doing the WOD a single time, watch me do it:
