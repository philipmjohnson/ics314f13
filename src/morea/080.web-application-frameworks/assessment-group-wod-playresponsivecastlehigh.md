  Students worked in groups in-class to create a Play application implementing a responsive version of a
  Castle High web page. 

  Discussion:

     * Three groups did not complete this task in the 60 minutes provided.
     * The Play framework has a significant learning curve and many students did not appear to have spent
       much time on it yet.
