# Practice WOD: MultiPage PlayBootstrapBrowserHistory

Before starting this WOD, you should review the function of the “routes” file in Play and how it connects HTTP requests to controller actions. You’ll also need some basic understanding of view files.

## Instructions

  1. Start your timer.
  2. Create a Play application called MultiPagePlayBootstrapBrowserHistory by downloading the play-bootstrap-template repository, then renaming the directory, the Eclipse project, and the Play project to “MultiPagePlayBootstrapBrowserHistory”.  
  3. Enable Checkstyle on your project.   If there are any errors or warnings, remove them.
  4. Create an application containing four pages: an index page with the overview of browser history, and three other pages containing history of IE, FireFox, and Chrome.   Use BootstrapBrowserHistory as your basis for these pages. 

The resulting application home page should look like this:

{% include small-img.html url="http://ics314f13.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/multipagehome.png" %}

And a page related to a specific browser should look like this:

{% include small-img.html url="http://ics314f13.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/multipageie.png" %}

Note that the navbar highlights the active page.

When finished, stop your timer, and record how many minutes it took you to complete the WOD. 

{% include wod-times.html Rx="<17 min" Av="17-21 min" Sd="21-25 min" DNF="25+ min" %}

## Demonstration

Once you've finished doing the WOD a single time, watch me do it:
