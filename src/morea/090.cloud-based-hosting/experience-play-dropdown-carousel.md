# Interlude: Play Dropdown Carousel

The next WOD (Surferpedia) will ask you to use two components of Bootstrap you might not have encountered before: [drop-down menu](http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#dropdowns) and [carousel](http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#carousel).   In order to make the upcoming WOD more effective, you should now create a [“spike solution”](http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules/spike.html) to provide you with working template code for both drop-down menus and the carousel.

To do this, make a copy of [play-bootstrap-template](https://github.com/ics-software-engineering/play-bootstrap-template), rename the directory, Eclipse project, and Play application to play-dropdown-carousel, and edit the application to include a drop-down menu in the navbar and a carousel with three images on the home page.

Here’s what mine looks like:

Once you have spent some time developing your own template, you can watch this screencast where I discuss my approach:
