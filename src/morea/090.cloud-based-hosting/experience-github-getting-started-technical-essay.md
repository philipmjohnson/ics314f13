# A15: GitHub getting started technical essay

By the date and time indicated on the calendar page, you should have worked through all of the resources related to git and GitHub listed on the Cloud-based Hosting module page, and created your GitHub account and profile following the GitHub Guidelines.

You must then write a blog entry that summarizes your experiences getting started with git and GitHub.  What did you find interesting about this experience?  What did you find to be difficult?   Make sure your writing is “for the world”, not “for the instructor”.

Send johnson@hawaii.edu an email with a link to your finished blog entry. Make sure your link starts with “http:” so that I can click on it in my mailer. Make sure that it also appears as one of your postings when someone clicks on the “Postings” link of your professional portfolio.  Note: the subject line must be [ICS 314: A15].  If the subject line is different, then I might not see the email and you might not get credit for this assignment.
