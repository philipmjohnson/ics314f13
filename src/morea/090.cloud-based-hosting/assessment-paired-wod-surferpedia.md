  This was the first paired WOD of the semester: students added a new page to a partnerâ€™s Surferpedia website.  To make matters more complicated, they could not speak to their partner; all interactions had to be through Google Hangout; and they shared their code through GitHub repositories.  The goal of this WOD is to test both website manipulation skills as well as software engineering collaboration skills.

  Discussion:

     * Again, relatively few DNFs on this WOD.
