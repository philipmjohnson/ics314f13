# Practice WOD: GitHubPlayResponsiveKamanu

Prior to doing this WOD, you should have studied git and GitHub using the links in the Resources section of this module. You should have also completed the PlayResponsiveKamanu WOD from the last module and have that project source code available.  Finally, you should have completed A15, so that you have a GitHub account.

## Instructions

For this WOD, you will publish your PlayResponsiveKamanu application as a GitHub repository. 

  1. Start your timer.
  2. Create a repo called PlayResponsiveKamanu on GitHub. You do not need to specify a .gitignore file (your project already has one), but you do need to specify a license.  Any of the three licenses in bold will do, but if you want more information, you can review ChooseALicence.com.
  3. Once your repo is created, clone it to your computer.
  4. Copy the files in your PlayResponsiveKamanu folder to your new cloned repo directory.
  5. Start up the Play console in your newly created repo directory, and invoke the “eclipse” command to regenerate the .project and .classpath files.
  6. Import the project into Eclipse. (You may need to delete the previous version of PlayResponsiveKamanu first).
  7. Edit the README.md file to include a screenshot, and the following sections: Overview, Installation, Usage, Credits.   Just a sentence or two per section are fine for this WOD. Put the screenshot in the doc/ directory, and delete the template files in there.
  8. Commit your changes. Check to make sure no derived files are going to be committed, and edit the .gitignore file if necessary to prevent this.
  9. View the repo on GitHub to see that the README displays correctly.
  10. Set up an end-user home page using GitHub Pages.

When done, the github project page should look like this:

{% include small-img.html url="http://ics314f13.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/kamanu-developer-home-page.png" %}

and the end-user GitHub Page should look like this:

{% include small-img.html url="http://ics314f13.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/kamanu-enduser-home-page.png" %}

When finished, stop your timer, and record how many minutes it took you to complete the WOD.

## Demonstration

Once you've finished doing the WOD a single time, watch me do it:
