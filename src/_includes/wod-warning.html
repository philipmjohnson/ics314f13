## Standard Warning

You’ll learn significantly less from watching me solve the
WOD if you haven’t attempted the WOD yourself first.

After watching my solution, I recommend that you repeat the WOD if you
have not achieved at least Av performance. If so, be sure to:

  * Delete your old project so you cannot refer to it;
  * Don’t look at my screencast while you WOD; and
  * Reset your timer.

Feel free to keep trying until you make Rx if that’s of interest to you.
