## How to repeat the WOD

To repeat the WOD, simply switch your local workspace branch to master, then create a new branch off of master called “Attempt-2″ (or whatever attempt you are on). Then, in the play console, type `; clean ; compile ; run` to  clean the target directory, then recompile the system, then run the web application.
