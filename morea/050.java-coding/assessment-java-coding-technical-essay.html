<p>This assessment evaluated the ability of students to write a high quality technical essay summarizing their experiences doing the Java Coding practice WODs.</p>

<p>Discussion:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Please report all of the times for all of your attempts, and discuss what changed between attempts.  This provides a reader with insight into how exactly you learn from doing the same programming problem more than once. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Take time to reflect upon your experience. That is an important part of the learning experience.  These blog postings are ultimately for you, not for me.  Make them valuable.   Donâ€™t finish the WODs at 8:55pm on Tuesday leaving you only 5 minutes to throw together a posting.  That eliminates a learning opportunity.</p>
