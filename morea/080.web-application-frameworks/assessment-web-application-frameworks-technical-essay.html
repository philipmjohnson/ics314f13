    <p>This assessment evaluated the ability of students to write a high quality technical essay summarizing their experiences doing the Web Application Frameworks practice WODs.</p>

<p>Discussion:</p>

<ul>
  <li>There are only a few of you who are actually succeeding in “writing for the world”.  Many of your posts, quite frankly, are pretty boring to read.   Those of you who are doing it right are creating little “stories” with a beginning (setting the stage, what your background regarding the material is, etc.), a middle (the actual WOD experiences), and an end (conclusions and insights).  </li>
  <li>It feels weird to me to take off points because a blog post is “boring”, but maybe I should start doing it just to get your creative juices flowing.   If you came across your own postings online, would you want to work with yourself?   Do you think, “Wow, this person is creative, intelligent, and probably fun to hang out with!” </li>
