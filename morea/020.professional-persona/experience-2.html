<h2 id="goal">Goal</h2>

<p>The goal of this assignment is for you to gain some experience using Java-
based open source systems, and to gain an appreciation for the difficulties
involved with achieving the <a href="http://ics314f13.wordpress.com/course-info/the-prime-
directives/">Three Prime Directives of Open Source Software
Engineering</a>. To do this, you will take the role of a user of an open source
systems, and try to download, install, and use the package. You will write up
your experiences for presentation in class and submission.</p>

<h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>

<p>Go to <a href="https://github.com/search?l=java&amp;o=desc&amp;q=stars%3A%3E1&amp;s=stars&amp;type=Repositories">https://github.com/search?l=java&amp;o=desc&amp;q=stars%3A%3E1&amp;s=stars&amp;type=Repositories</a>, which will retrieve a listing of Java-based projects sorted
such that those with the most stars are listed first. Look through this list
for a Java-based open source project that looks interesting to you. If you’re
not interested in Android, you may have to search past the first few pages of
hits. Attempt to download, install, and use the system. Then create a posting
in your professional portfolio site that summarizes your experience. The entry
should have the following sections:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Overview. This section describes the package you downloaded, its URL, and its stated objectives.  You will also want to overview <a href="http://ics314f13.wordpress.com/course-info/the-prime-directives/">the three prime directives of open source software engineering</a>.</li>
  <li>Prime Directive 1. This section presents your opinion as to whether PD#1 is satisfied. If so, what useful functionality is provided?</li>
  <li>Prime Directive 2. This section presents your opinion as to whether PD#2 is satisfied. Was it possible for you as a non-developer of the system to download, install, and actually benefit from the useful functionality?</li>
  <li>Prime Directive 3. This section presents your opinion as to whether PD#3 is satisfied. If you were going to attempt to modify and improve the system, how easy would it be for you to do so? Does the package include developer-level documentation to support this process?</li>
</ul>

<p>Your entry should be well written and of professional caliber. It should
consist of complete sentences, and contain no spelling errors or grammatical
mistakes. View this as similar to a preliminary report to the Chief Technology
Officer of a high tech company regarding whether or not the open source
package should be adopted by the company or not. For each Prime Directive,
provide actual examples (“evidence”) from your usage of the system to justify
your opinion. Include at least one screen image to illustrate how the program
looks. Make sure that when I click on the “Postings” menu item in your
professional portfolio, this posting appears along with others. If not, you
have probably not set up your “Categories” correctly. See the screencast for
more details. You must work alone on this project.</p>

<h2 id="submission-instructions">Submission instructions</h2>

<p>By the date and time on the Schedule page, send johnson@hawaii.edu an email
containing the URL to your posting. Your URL should start with “http:” so that
my mailer will recognize it as an URL and make it clickable. Note: the
subject line must be <strong>[ICS 314: A05]</strong>. If the subject line is different,
then I might not see the email and you might not get credit for this
assignment.</p>
