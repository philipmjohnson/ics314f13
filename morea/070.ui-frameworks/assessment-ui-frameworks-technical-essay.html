    <p>This assessment evaluated the ability of students to write a high quality technical essay summarizing their experiences doing the UI Frameworks practice WODs.</p>

<p>Discussion:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I still feel like many of you are not creating postings that will impress future employers when they read them, because I think some of you are still writing for me, not the world. </li>
  <li>Please do not repost my long bullet list of requirements.  Instead, summarize the goal of the WOD in a paragraph, perhaps augmented with a screenshot.</li>
  <li>As long as you make a single attempt at each WOD, and follow these guidelines, you can get full credit for this assignment. That said, I think it is crazy to not repeat the practice WOD until you get to at least Av performance.  From reading your entries, it is clear that many of you learn substantially more on the second and even third attempts.  Donâ€™t deny yourselves the learning opportunity!</li>
