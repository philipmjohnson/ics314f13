  <p>For this module, you will have an opportunity to apply your newly developed skills in rapid software development over the course of the first weekend in November (Friday, November 1, to Sunday, November 3).  There are two alternative ways you can fulfill the requirements for this module.</p>

<h1 id="participate-in-startup-weekend">Participate in Startup Weekend</h1>

<p>The first, and preferred alternative, is for you to sign up for and participate in the upcoming <a href="http://uofhawaii.startupweekend.org/">University of Hawaii Startup Weekend</a>.  To learn more about the event, you can read through the links on the <a href="http://startupweekend.org/about/firsttimer/">FAQ page</a>.</p>

<p>There are two “costs” for this alternative:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The $40 registration fee.</li>
  <li>Your time:  Friday evening, Saturday all day and evening, Sunday all day.</li>
</ol>

<p>Those two costs provide substantial benefits:</p>

<ul>
  <li>7 meals (the $40 fee is to cover the cost of the food).</li>
  <li>A unique educational experience.</li>
  <li>The opportunity to apply your GitHub, Twitter Bootstrap, Eclipse,  Play, and CloudBees web development skills in a “real-world” format.   (Whether you actually apply these skills depends upon what your team needs. You are under no obligation to actually do any web development this weekend to fulfill the requirements of this module.  The only requirement is to participate.)</li>
  <li>The guarantee of having a new “project” to add to your professional portfolio and resume at the end of the weekend.   (Having participated in a startup weekend will be viewed very favorably by employers, and will put you ahead of many other students.)</li>
  <li>Excellent networking opportunities.  You might meet your future employer (or someone who knows your future employer) at this event.</li>
  <li>35 points of class credit for participation. (full credit of 25 points + 10 points extra credit).  You will obtain full credit plus extra credit for simply participating; I will not “grade” your team’s submission.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you choose this alternative, then you should do the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Register by October 15, so that you get the $40 early bird rate.</li>
  <li>Send johnson@hawaii.edu an email by October 15 letting me know that you have registered. (If you hope to participate, but cannot commit by October 15, then send me an email by October 15 letting me know your situation and when you’ll know for sure.)</li>
  <li>I recognize that some of you might have work or family obligations on the weekend.  I would like you to consider attempting to reorganize your schedule for just this one weekend so that you can take advantage of this opportunity.  This single weekend could have a significant positive impact on your professional career.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you feel intimidated by this alternative, just suck it up and go for it.  I’ve been forcing you to do WODs every week all semester so that you get used to programming under pressure.  Startup Weekend will be nothing by comparison!</p>
